# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. API Struct Field Mapping Issue ✅
**Problem**: The API was querying `current_version` from the database but the Rust struct expected `version`.
**Fix**: Updated both `latest.rs` and `trending.rs` to use `current_version` directly in the struct.

### 2. CORS Headers Missing ✅
**Problem**: API endpoints were missing CORS headers, preventing frontend from calling them.
**Fix**: Added proper CORS headers to both endpoints:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type`
- Added OPTIONS preflight handling

### 3. Error Handling in Frontend ✅
**Problem**: Frontend hooks were throwing errors on API failures, breaking the UI.
**Fix**: Updated hooks to return empty arrays on error instead of throwing, with detailed logging.

### 4. API Response Validation ✅
**Problem**: Frontend wasn't handling potential null/undefined response data.
**Fix**: Added null checks and default to empty arrays in the hooks.

## Current State

The following components have been updated and should now work:

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/v1/agents/latest` - Returns latest agents with proper field names
   - `/api/v1/agents/trending` - Returns trending agents with fallback to regular query

2. **Frontend Hooks**:
   - `useLatestAgents()` - Fetches from optimized endpoint with error handling
   - `useTrendingAgents()` - Fetches from optimized endpoint with error handling

3. **Database Schema**:
   - Confirmed that `current_version`, `author_name`, and `download_count` fields exist
   - Migrations are in place to ensure fields are populated

## Remaining Issues to Check

### 1. Environment Variables in Production
The frontend API URL configuration depends on environment detection. In production (Vercel), it should use the same origin (empty string). Make sure:
- Vercel deployment has the correct environment variables set
- Database connection strings are properly configured in Vercel

### 2. Database Migrations
Ensure these migrations have been run in production:
- `20250727230000_verify_agents_schema.sql` - Adds required fields
- `20250801120000_add_trending_score_function.sql` - Adds trending calculation
- `20250801130000_ensure_trending_view_populated.sql` - Creates materialized view

### 3. Supabase RLS Policies
The leaderboard uses direct Supabase queries. Ensure:
- RLS policies allow anonymous users to read `agents` table
- RLS policies allow reading `profiles` table
- The Supabase URL and anon key are correct in production

## Testing the Fix

1. **Check API endpoints directly**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/v1/agents/latest
   curl https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/v1/agents/trending
   ```

2. **Check browser console** for any errors when loading the page

3. **Verify Supabase connection** by checking if stats/leaderboard loads

## Next Steps if Still Not Working

1. **Check Vercel logs** for API errors
2. **Verify database has data** by running queries directly in Supabase
3. **Check browser network tab** to see exact API responses
4. **Ensure materialized view exists** and is populated in production database
